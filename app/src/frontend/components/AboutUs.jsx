          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Meal Sharing began as a simple idea: to unite people over food. What
            started as a small, community-focused dining concept has grown into
            a welcoming restaurant that celebrates culinary diversity, cultural
            exchange, and meaningful connections around the table.
